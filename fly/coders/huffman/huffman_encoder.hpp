     * Huffman encode a stream.
     *
     * If the input stream is large, in order to limit memory usage, the stream
     * is encoded in chunks. Each chunk is treated as its own input stream, and
     * the encoding sequence is repeated for each chunk.
     *
     * The first bytes of the output stream are reserved as a header. Currently,
     * the header contains: the incurred BitStream header, the version of the
     * Huffman coder used to encode the stream, the maximum chunk length used to
     * to split large streams (in kilobytes), and the maximum allowed Huffman
     * code length:
     *
     *     |      8 bits      |  8 bits |      16 bits      |      8 bits     |
     *     --------------------------------------------------------------------
     *     | BitStream header | Version | Chunk length (KB) | Max code length |
     *
     * The sequence to encode a stream is:
     *
     *     1. Create a Huffman tree from the input stream.
     *     2. Generate standard Huffman codes from the Huffman tree.
     *     3. Length-limit the standard Huffman codes.
     *     4. Convert the length-limited codes to canonical Huffman codes.
     *     5. Encode the canonical codes.
     *     6. Encode the input stream using the canonical codes.
     *
     * This sequence involves iterating over the entire input stream twice (to
     * create the Huffman tree and to encode the stream).
     *
     * The coder does not assume the Huffman codes are retained between calls.
     * Thus, the codes are encoded before the input stream (step 5) so that they
     * may be learned during decoding.
     *
     * Length-limiting is performed on the generated Huffman codes to improve
     * decoder performance. Worst-case, a Huffman code could have the same
     * length as the maximum number of symbols. Limiting the length of Huffman
     * codes awards a significant decoder performance improvement, while only
     * incurring a small cost in compression ratio.
     *
     * Canonical form is used for its property of generally being describable in
     * fewer bits than standard form. When in canonical form, the Huffman codes
     * are sorted by code length. With this sorting, the count of the number of
     * symbols for each code length is computed: (N0, N1, N2, ..., Nn), where
     * N<n> is the number of symbols of code length <n>. Call the length of this
     * list NN.
     *
     * The encoding of canonical Huffman codes then becomes:
     *
     *      NN,N0,N1,N2,...,Nn,S0,S1,S2,...,Sn
     *
     * Where S<n> is all symbols of code length <n>.
     *
     * Encoding the input stream (step 6) consists of reading each symbol from
     * the input stream and outputting that symbol's canonical Huffman code.
     *
     * @param decoded Stream holding the contents to encode.
     * @param encoded Stream to store the encoded contents.

     * @return True if the input stream was successfully encoded.
